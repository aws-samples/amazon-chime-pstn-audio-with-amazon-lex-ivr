  How to build a smart interactive voice response (IVR) call routing system
</h1>
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems gather information from customers, help
them find information quickly, and route callers to the right destination. An
intelligent IVR system can help customers avoid frustration and complete tasks
quickly. Using the
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk">Amazon Chime SDK</a>, builders
can easily create smart call routing IVR solutions to deliver a seamless end
user experience using Amazon Chime Voice Connector SIP trunking or the Public
Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
<h2>What is IVR Call Routing?</h2>
Interactive Voice Response (IVR) systems are phone routing tools that allow
callers to hear specific information they ask for and gather information from a
caller. IVRs work by providing prompts to callers and allowing them to respond
using their own voice or via dual-tone multi frequency (DTMF) input on their
phones. IVRs are commonly used in automated, self-service use cases to reduce
the dependency on human interaction to obtain information or take specific
actions. There is a high probability that you have interacted with an IVR if you
have ever called a number to check your bank account balance, pay a bill, or get
the status of a recent order. A second common IVR use case is to allow callers
to be routed to destinations such as departments or external vendors that are on
different telephone systems or contact centers (e.g. “speak to an agent”). The
service supports bridging calls to PSTN phone numbers and SIP trunks using
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/features/#SIP_Trunking"
  >Amazon Chime Voice Connectors</a
>. In this blog post, we will show you how you can use these capabilities to
create a simple IVR with Amazon Lex that can intelligently route calls between
multiple telephone systems using the Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio service.

Call Routing with Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio[/caption]
<h2>What is Intelligent IVR?</h2>
Intelligent IVRs use artificial intelligence to route calls, rather than
utilizing a customer service representative. In the architecture below,
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lex/">Amazon Lex</a> uses natural language
processing to understand spoken commands, then routes a caller to the right
destination. The
<a
  href="https://aws.amazon.com/chime/chime-sdk/features/#Public_Switched_Telephone_Network_.28PSTN.29_Audio"
  >Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio service</a
>
integrates with Amazon Lex, and enables builders to create serverless
applications that provide conversational interfaces for calls to or from the
public switched telephone network (PSTN).
<h2>How to Build an IVR: Solution Overview</h2>
Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio service works with an
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/">AWS Lambda</a> function to provide
programmable telephony and can be built to route calls based on a wide range of
conditions. In this demo we will be using an Amazon Lex bot to capture
information from a caller and use it to make a routing decision. Other
conditions could be used such as the time of day, calling number, called number,
or DTMF input. External data sources or services like
<a href="https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/">Amazon DynamoDB</a> can be accessed
by the AWS Lambda function to inform the routing decision. [caption

      >AWS Command Line Interface</a
    >
    (AWS CLI)
    <a
      href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html"
      >installed</a
    >
  </li>
  <li>AWS Account with appropriate permissions</li>

    allowance for Amazon Chime SDK Phone Numbers
  </li>
</ul>
This demo also assumes intermediate knowledge of the Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio
service and Amazon Lex. As a primer, we recommend completing the AWS workshop:
<a
  href="https://catalog.us-east-1.prod.workshops.aws/workshops/30bd753c-9563-4c7c-8d1a-75460642550c/en-US"
  >Building Telephony-Powered Applications with the Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio
  Service</a
>. For background information on Amazon Lex and the terminology and features
used in this demo, please see
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/how-it-works.html"
  >Amazon Lex: How It Works</a
>.
<h2>Walkthrough</h2>
The
<a
  href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-pstn-audio-with-amazon-lex-ivr"
  >sample code</a
>
referenced in this blog post will deploy a functional IVR demo that you can
configure to route calls to either a Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN)
number or directly to an Amazon Chime SDK Voice Connector. This routing decision
will be made based on the information passed from the Amazon Lex bot to the
Amazon Chime SDK SIP media application. Calls routed to an Amazon Chime Voice
Connector will contain additional Session Initiation Protocol (SIP) headers to
pass information to the SIP user agent. At a high level, the demo consists of
two components:
<ul>
  <li>
    Back-end resources that include:
    <ul>
      <li>AWS Lambda functions</li>
      <li>Amazon Chime Voice Connectors and SIP media applications</li>
      <li>Amazon DynamoDB Table</li>
      <li>Amazon S3 Bucket</li>
      <li>Amazon Lex bot</li>
      <li>
        Amazon EC2 Instance and AWS Networking components used for the Asterisk
        Private Branch Exchange (PBX) phone system.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    Web-based SIP client that is deployed locally and can be used to answer the
    incoming call.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Deploy Back-end Resources</h3>
Clone the demo repository and run yarn launch to deploy:
<pre><code class="lang-bash">git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-pstn-audio-with-amazon-lex-ivr
cd amazon-chime-pstn-audio-with-amazon-lex-ivr
yarn launch</code></pre>
<h3>Deploy Web-based SIP Client</h3>
Change to the site directory and launch the web-based SIP client locally:
<pre><code class="lang-bash">cd site
yarn
yarn run start</code></pre>
This will start a local server that can be accessed at
<code>http://localhost:8080</code>
Note: Deploying this demo and receiving traffic from the demo created in this
post can incur AWS charges. Be sure to deprovision unused components when
complete to avoid excess charges.
<h2>How It Works</h2>
After deploying the CDK, a phone number will be provided to you as one of the
outputs:
<pre><code class="lang-bash">Outputs:
ChimeLexIVR.pstnPhoneNumber = +1NPANXXXXXX</code></pre>
When this number is called, it will be delivered to an Amazon Chime SDK PSTN
Audio SIP media application. When the SIP media application answers, we will
preload information into the Amazon Lex session, then the
<a
  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/chime-sdk/latest/dg/start-bot-conversation.html"
  >startBotConversation </a
>action will connect the call to an Amazon Lex bot.
<pre><code class="lang-js">async function startSessions(event) {
  const putSessionCommandParams = {
    botAliasId: lexBotAliasId,
    botId: lexBotId,
    localeId: 'en_US',
    sessionId: event.CallDetails.Participants[0].CallId,
    sessionState: {
      SessionAttributes: {
        phoneNumber: event.CallDetails.Participants[0].From,
      },
      intent: {
        name: 'GetCallerType',
      },
      dialogAction: { type: 'ElicitSlot', slotToElicit: 'CallerType' },
    },
  };
  try {
    console.log(JSON.stringify(putSessionCommandParams, null, 3));
    await lexClient.send(new PutSessionCommand(putSessionCommandParams));
    return True;
  } catch (err) {
    console.log(`Error: ${err}`);
  }
}</code></pre>
When the Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio SIP media application starts the Lex bot
conversation, it will use the <code>CallId</code> of the caller as the
<code>sessionId</code> within the Lex bot. We wil use this to prepopulate the
slot to be used when the conversation actually starts. In this case, we will use
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/how-session-api.html"
  ><code>putSession</code> </a
>to tell the Lex bot to elicit a specific
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/build-slot-types.html"
  ><code>slot</code> </a
>on a specific
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lexv2/latest/dg/build-intents.html"
  ><code>intent</code> </a
>when the caller joins the conversation. This will allow us to immediately
capture the department name from the caller.
<pre><code class="lang-js">exports.handler = async (event, context, callback) =&gt;{
  console.log('Lambda is invoked with calldetails:' + JSON.stringify(event));
  let actions;
  switch (event.InvocationEventType) {
    case 'NEW_INBOUND_CALL':
     console.log('NEW INBOUND CALL');
     await startSessions(event);
     speakAction.Parameters.CallId = event.CallDetails.Participants[0].CallId;
     startBotConversationAction.Parameters.Configuration.SessionState.SessionAttributes.phoneNumber = event.CallDetails.Participants[0].From;
     actions = [speakAction, startBotConversationAction];
     break;</code></pre>
<h2>Amazon Lex Bot Processing</h2>
The Amazon Lex bot built in the demo contains two intents: [caption
id="attachment_3434" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img
  class="wp-image-3434 size-large"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/Intents-1024x285.png"
  alt="Amazon Lex Bot Intents"
  width="1024"
  height="285"
/>
Amazon Lex Bot Intents[/caption] Because we used putSession to elicit the
<code>Department</code> slot on the <code>RouteCall</code> intent, we will be
using that slot and looking for values within that slot. [caption
id="attachment_3431" align="alignnone" width="1024"]<img
  class="wp-image-3431 size-large"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/DepartmentsSlot-1024x835.png"
  alt="Amazon Lex Departments Slot"
  width="1024"
  height="835"
/>
Amazon Lex Departments Slot[/caption] Once the Amazon Lex Bot captures the slot,
we will need to verify that the Department spoken is a valid department. In
order to do this, an optional code hook is used to perform validation. This code
hook is an associated AWS Lambda function that will be executed at every turn of
the conversation. [caption id="attachment_3440" align="alignnone"
width="936"]<img
  class="wp-image-3440 size-full"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/CodeHooks.png"
  alt="Amazon Lex Code Hook Enabled"

Amazon Lex Code Hook Enabled[/caption]
<h3>Slot Validation</h3>
Once the Slot has been captured, validation will occur using a AWS Lambda
<a
  href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-pstn-audio-with-amazon-lex-ivr/blob/main/resources/lexHandler/index.py"
  >function </a
>associated to the Amazon Lex bot.
<pre><code class="lang-python">def RouteCall(intent_request):
    session_attributes = get_session_attributes(intent_request)
    slots = get_slots(intent_request)
    department = get_slot(intent_request, "Department")
    query_department = get_department(department)
    if query_department:
        print('querying department')
        text = "Connecting you to " + department + " department."
        message = {"contentType": "PlainText", "content": text}
        fulfillment_state = "Fulfilled"
        return close(session_attributes, "RouteCall", fulfillment_state, message)
    else:
        if 'failure_count' in session_attributes:
            print(f"Failure Count: {session_attributes['failure_count']}")
            if int(session_attributes['failure_count']) &gt;= 2:
                text = "Sorry, I couldn't find that department.  Let me connect you to an operator."
                message = {"contentType": "PlainText", "content": text}
                fulfillment_state = "Fulfilled"            
                return close(session_attributes, "RouteCall", fulfillment_state, message)
            else:
                session_attributes['failure_count'] = int(session_attributes['failure_count']) +  1
                try_ex(lambda: slots.pop("Department"))
                text = "Sorry, I couldn't find that department.  Can you try again?"
                message = {"contentType": "PlainText", "content": text}
                return elicit_slot(session_attributes, intent_request["sessionState"]["intent"]["name"],slots,"Department",message)
        else:
            session_attributes['failure_count'] = 1
            try_ex(lambda: slots.pop("Department"))
            text = "Sorry, I couldn't find that department.  Can you try again?"
            message = {"contentType": "PlainText", "content": text}
            return elicit_slot(session_attributes, intent_request["sessionState"]["intent"]["name"],slots,"Department",message)    </code></pre>
This AWS Lambda function will get the department spoken from the slot and
compare that to a list of department names stored in an Amazon DynamoDB table
pre-populated with sample department names (deployed as part of the CDK). The
Amazon Lex CodeHook function is invoked with a JSON event that will be parsed.
Below is a truncated example of the event. If a <code>department</code> is not
found in slots, a failure will be recorded and tracked using the
<a
  href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/context-mgmt-session-attribs.html"
  >session attributes</a
>
of the Amazon Lex bot. A failure will result in a retry of the slot. When the
<code>failure_count</code> exceeds 2, the call will be completed as closed with
a default route.
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  "sessionState": {
    "sessionAttributes": {},
    "activeContexts": [],
    "intent": {
      "slots": {
        "Department": {
          "shape": "Scalar",
          "value": {
            "originalValue": "history",
            "resolvedValues": ["history"],
            "interpretedValue": "history"
          }
        }
      },
      "confirmationState": "None",
      "name": "RouteCall",
      "state": "InProgress"
    },
    "originatingRequestId": "7be9976e-50df-4e07-9d99-670445c55102"
  }
}</code></pre>
<code>department</code> will be set to the <code>interpretatedValue</code> here.
In this case, <code>department</code> will be <code>history</code>. This value
is then queried against the Amazon DynamoDB table to see if it is a valid
department. [caption id="attachment_3441" align="alignnone" width="1430"]<img
  class="wp-image-3441 size-full"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/DynamoTable.png"
  alt="Amazon DynamoDB Departments Table"
  width="1430"
  height="1002"
/>
Amazon DynamoDB Departments Table[/caption]
<pre><code class="lang-python">def get_department(department_name):
  try:
    response = dynamodb_client.get_item(
      Key={
        "department_name": {
          "S": str(department_name),
        },
      },
      TableName=department_table,
    )
    if "Item" in response:
      return True
    else:
      return False
  except Exception as err:
    logger.error("DynamoDB Query error: failed to fetch data from table. Error: ", exc_info=err)
    return None</code></pre>
When <code>history </code>is queried in the Amazon DynamoDB table, it returns a
<code>True </code>value which will cause the AWS Lambda function to return the
following to the Lex bot:
<pre><code class="lang-json">{
  "messages": [
    {
      "contentType": "PlainText",
      "content": "Connecting you to history department."
    }
  ],
  "sessionState": {
    "dialogAction": { "type": "Close" },
    "sessionAttributes": {},
    "intent": { "name": "RouteCall", "state": "Fulfilled" }
  }
}</code></pre>
This JSON will tell the Amazon Lex bot the intent has been fulfilled and should
be closed and play the
<code>Connecting you to history department</code> message.
<h3>Return to SIP media application</h3>
Once the RouteCall intent has been closed in the Amazon Lex bot, the information
will be returned to the Amazon Chime SDK SIP media application and the
associated AWS Lambda function will be invoked with an InvocationEventType:
ACTION_SUCCESSFUL with Type: StartBotConversation indicating that the Amazon Lex
processing was completed successfully. The AWS Lambda function associated with
the Amazon Chime SDK SIP media application will then use the information it
received to determine how to route the call:
<pre><code class="lang-js">case 'ACTION_SUCCESSFUL':
console.log('ACTION SUCCESSFUL');
switch (event.ActionData.Type) {
  case 'StartBotConversation':
  console.log('StartBotConversation Success');
  const callerIdNumber = event.CallDetails.Participants[0].From;
  let lexDepartment;
  let route = {};
  if ('Department' in event.ActionData.IntentResult.SessionState.Intent.Slots ) {
    lexDepartment = event.ActionData.IntentResult.SessionState.Intent.Slots.Department.Value.InterpretedValue;
    route = await getRoute(lexDepartment);
    console.log(`Route from DynamoDB: ${route}`);
    console.log(`lexDepartment from event: ${lexDepartment}`);
  } else {
    lexDepartment = 'Unknown';
    route.service = 'voiceConnector';
    route.number = '000000';
  }
  switch (route.service) {
    case 'voiceConnector':
      console.log('Using Amazon Chime Voice Connector Routing');
      vcCallAndBridgeAction.Parameters.CallerIdNumber = callerIdNumber;
      vcCallAndBridgeAction.Parameters.SipHeaders['X-LexInfo'] = lexDepartment;
      vcCallAndBridgeAction.Parameters.Endpoints[0].Uri = route.number;
      actions = [vcCallAndBridgeAction];
      break;
    case 'pstnNumber':
      console.log('Using PSTN Routing');
      pstnCallAndBridgeAction.Parameters.CallerIdNumber = callerIdNumber;
      pstnCallAndBridgeAction.Parameters.Endpoints[0].Uri = route.number;
      actions = [pstnCallAndBridgeAction];
      break;
    default:
      break;
    } 
  break;</code></pre>
When the SIP media application determines that the
<code>ACTION_SUCCESSFUL </code>is for a
<code>StartBotConversation</code> ActionData Type, the AWS Lambda function will
extract the <code>lexDepartment</code> from the json in the event if it exists.
<pre><code class="lang-json">"SessionState": {
  "SessionAttributes": {},
  "Intent": {
    "Name": "RouteCall",
    "Slots": {
      "Department": {
        "Value": {
          "OriginalValue": "history",
          "InterpretedValue": "history",
          "ResolvedValues": ["history"]
        },
        "Values": []
      }
    },
    "State": "Fulfilled",
    "ConfirmationState": "None"
  }
},</code></pre>
It will then query the associated Department Amazon DynamoDB table to determine
which service to use to route the call and the number to use as the Uri when
making this call. In the above Table example, all of the calls will be routed to
the Amazon Chime Voice Connector.
<h3>vcCallAndBridgeAction</h3>
The <code>vcCallAndBridgeAction</code> and
<code>pstnCallAndBridgeAction</code> will both bridge calls, however, the
<code>vcCallAndBridgeAction</code> will allow you to send calls to an Amazon
Chime Voice Connector instead of a PSTN number. This will allow you to send
additional SIP headers in the INVITE.
<pre><code class="lang-js">{
  "SchemaVersion": "1.0",
  "Actions": [
    {
      "Type": "CallAndBridge",
      "Parameters": {
        "CallTimeoutSeconds": 30,
        "CallerIdNumber": "+1NPANXXXXXX",
        "Endpoints": [
          {
            "Uri": "600300",
            "BridgeEndpointType": "AWS",
            "Arn": "arn:aws:chime:us-east-1:104621577074:vc/ehwryzdm9hy4u6rrud7jym"
          }
        ],
        "SipHeaders": {
          "X-LexInfo": "history",
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}</code></pre>
In this example, the call is placed with a URI containing
<code>600300</code> and delivered to an Amazon Chime Voice Connector which will
deliver the call to the associated host.

<img
  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3437"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/VoiceConnector.png"
  alt=""
  width="1430"
  height="770"
/>

As shown in this example, the department captured in the Amazon Lex bot will be
delivered as a SIP header to the Asterisk server that is built as part of this
deployment. The Request URI will contain the URI defined in the
<code>CallAndBridge</code> action combined with the Inbound route of the Amazon
Chime Voice Connector.
<pre><code class="lang-sip">INVITE sip:600300@192.0.2.31:5060;transport=UDP SIP/2.0
From: &lt;sip:+1NPANXXXXXX@10.0.174.226:5060&gt;;tag=56Htvc9UXX7Ug
To: &lt;sip:600300@192.0.2.31:5060&gt;;transport=UDP
X-Lexinfo: history

X-Amzn-TargetArn: arn:aws:chime:us-east-1:104621577074:vc/ehwryzdm9hy4u6rrud7jym</code></pre>
<h3>SIP Client</h3>
Also included in this demo is a web-based SIP client that can optionally be used
to answer the incoming call. This SIP client can be used to answer the call and
establish two-way audio.

<img
  class="alignnone size-full wp-image-3439"
  src="https://d2908q01vomqb2.cloudfront.net/98fbc42faedc02492397cb5962ea3a3ffc0a9243/2022/08/13/Client.png"
  alt=""
  width="1430"
  height="727"
/>
<h4>Audio Playback</h4>
If the included SIP client is not used, the Asterisk server will answer the call
and play back a wav file to the caller based on the department captured in the
Amazon Lex bot. During the EC2 instance deployment, a
<a
  href="https://github.com/aws-samples/amazon-chime-pstn-audio-with-amazon-lex-ivr/blob/main/resources/asteriskConfig/createWav.py"
  >Python script</a
>
is executed as part of the
<a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/user-data.html"
  >user-data</a
>
passed to the instance. This Python script will create wav files by calling
Polly using
<a href="https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html"
  >Boto3</a
>.

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
This blog post has demonstrated the benefits of integrating the programmatic
telephony routing capabilities of Amazon Chime SDK PSTN Audio service with
conversational interfaces powered by Amazon Lex. We’ve shown how these services
can be used to build an IVR that can help intelligently route callers to
multiple telephone systems, like a contact center, over Amazon Chime Voice
Connector SIP trunking or the PSTN. The Amazon Chime SDK PSTN audio is available
in US-East-1 and US-West-2 AWS regions. To learn more about the PSTN Audio
conversational voice experience and call bridging, refer to the Amazon Chime SDK
PSTN Audio Developer Guide and visit the GitHub Repository for the sample code.
